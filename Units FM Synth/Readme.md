This is a Synthesizer plugin that demonstrates the usage of unit types with JUCE's audio and dsp parameter classes. The synthesizer is a subtractive FM synth, with an FM oscillator going into a lowpass filter. The synth has three modes, MIDI, MPE, and auto. In MIDI mode, all incoming midi data is assumed to be MIDI, and the output of the oscillator is multiplied by an ADSR. All oscillators are then fed into a master filter. In MPE mode, all incoming midi data is assumed to be MPE. The pitch control controls the carrier and modulator oscillators' frequency, the timbre control controls the modulation depth, and the pressure control controls both the filter cutoff and the oscillator's volume. In this mode, each voice has its own filter, so that each voice's pressure value changes its sound. In auto mode, incoming midi data is parsed and split into MIDI and MPE data. The MIDI data gets routed to the MIDI synthesizer, and the MPE data gets routed to the MPE synthesizer.

Building the synthesizer requires C++17 and a copy of JUCE. Running the tests also requires CMake and Catch to be installed - tests can be built and run by using the CMakeLists in the test directory. When doing so, you must pass the path to your JUCE modules folder as an argument. This looks like -DJUCE_PATH"Path to JUCE/modules". Finally, build the resulting project, and then run the resulting binaries.
